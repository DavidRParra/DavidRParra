## Hi there! My name is David Parra ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I started programming because I thought it was fun and that I could do many things.  
To this day I still find the world of programming fun, after years in this world of development.  
I like to automate tasks, create web pages and teach others what I have learned so they can see the fun in this world.
